CURRENT FOCUS: Implement autofill suggestions for item name field in Add Item form
  - Will need to use something like a <ul> most likely
  - onClick for suggestions will fill fields with the name and category of that item and will disable creating a new item in 'items' database table server-side
    > When creating a new item, send item, category, quantity, AND item_id. If item is completely new, item_id will be something like -1, which would be a sign to create a new row in the items table for that item, generating a unique item id for it. If it isn't -1, then use existing item_id in grocery_list_items table.



Have a version of the table that lists all items on a grocery store list with the columns:
Name, Category, Quantity, Options (Edit/Delete)

Another version that lists stuff by category:
 - Probably use Accordian object from bootstrap-react, with custom headers
   > Headers would display category name and a little badge displaying the number of items under that category







Database Tables:
----------------
users:
- user_id (autogenerated)
- username
- password_hash

categories:
- category_id (autogenerated)
- name

items:
- item_id (autogenerated)
- name
- category_id (from 'categories' table)

grocery_lists:
- list_id (autogenerated)
- name
- creation_date
- update_date

grocery_list_users:
- list_id
- user_id

grocery_list_items:
- list_id
- item_id
- quantity


===========================
Loading into /dashboard should return a JSON object containing all items in the currently selected list. Each item is represented by a dict containing keys 'name' 'category', 'quantity', 'item_id'. It will also send a list of categories, each is a dict with keys 'name' and 'category'.

For the add item/edit item forms, for the item name, autofill suggestions should pop up whenever input is changed and 3+ characters are in the field. If an autofill suggestion is selected, the existing item_id should be used to replace the current item_id in the list table. 







CONCURRENTLY:
To start client and server together, use 'concurrently' Node.js package

I will currently install it in the project root, but in the future, when the app is actually hosted, 
it might be better to switch to Docker containerization 

To install 'concurrently':
```bash
npm install --save-dev concurrently
```

Then create a ```package.json``` in the project root and add the following:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently \"cd client && npm start\" \"cd server && flask run\""
}
```

Then you just run
```bash
npm run dev
```
